  <p>The stars are great globes of hot, glowing gas just like our sun. They contain a great deal of hydrogen and helium gases. They shine by changing hydrogen into helium in the vast nuclear furnaces of their central core. Astronomers have discovered that the stars contain most of the other elements found on the earth.</p>
