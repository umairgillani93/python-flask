  <h1>Welcome to FlaskApp Home page :)</h1>
  <h2>Here's a walkthrough to the App!</h2>
  <p>Above are some of the options available for you to navigrate across. Each option says pretty much
  its working functionality. You can Add the kittens into the Database created using Flask ORM (Object Relational Mapper).
  You can check out the list of added entries by hitting at List Kitten option manually, or it would automatically redirect you to the List of available kittens page, each time you add or delete one from Database. Also, you can delete them from Database using their corresponding
  ID's.</p>
  <p>BTW I've chosen kittens operations for the App, cuz I find them adorable the most! :)</p>
  <p>Go ahead, and give it a try..</p>
